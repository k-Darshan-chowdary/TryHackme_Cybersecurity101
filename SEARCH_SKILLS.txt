EVOLUTION OF THE SEARCH RESULTS:-

It is our job, as readers, to evaluate the information. We will mention a few things to consider when evaluating information:

-Source: Identify the author or organization publishing the information. Consider whether they are reputable and authoritative on the subject matter. Publishing a blog post does not make one an authority on the subject.
-Evidence and reasoning: Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments.
-Objectivity and bias: Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives. We are not interested in authors pushing shady agendas, whether to promote a product or attack a rival.
-Corroboration and consistency: Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check whether multiple reliable and reputable sources agree on the central claims.
