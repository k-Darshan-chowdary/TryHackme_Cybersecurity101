GUIs are easier for beginners, but CLIs become faster and more efficient once mastered. Command-line interfaces reduce reliance on the mouse, save time, and allow quick repetition of tasks. They also use fewer system resources, support easy automation through scripts, and enable efficient remote management via tools like SSH. The goal is to learn Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) to view system information, troubleshoot networks, manage files, and monitor running processes.
